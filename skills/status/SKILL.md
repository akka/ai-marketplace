description: "Show a read-only rollup of the definition of done — every exit condition with its state, properties, and open reason — without running any auditor."
---

## User Input

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Before anything else

Run `akka specify mode --allows status`. It exits non-zero when the project's mode
does not permit this command to be invoked directly. On a non-zero exit, print
its message verbatim and stop. Do not continue, and do not work around it.

Enforced mode gives the sequence to the engine, so the steps it sequences are
refused when a person invokes them. The message names the remedy.

## Purpose

`/akka:status` prints the current definition-of-done manifest: every exit
condition grouped by Definition-of-Done type, with its state (`open`, `green`,
or `red`), its properties (provenance, waiver, applicability), and any `open`
reason. The two locked process-integrity gates, `PROC-AUDITOR-COVERAGE` and
`PROC-ADEQUACY-REVIEWED`, appear among the conditions like any other.

The manifest reflects the project's own state — waived, struck, and signed-off
conditions appear as such — so it agrees with `/akka:conform`.

**Status never runs an auditor.** It does not build, test, lint, or probe. That
is the whole difference from `/akka:conform`: machine-checkable conditions stay
`open` here until conform evaluates them. Once conform has run, the two agree.

Because it changes nothing and costs nothing, status is the command to reach
for during an autonomous build — it shows progress without interrupting the
machine.

## Outline

1. **Render the manifest.** Call `akka_ec_status` for the project directory.
   This resolves the exit-condition library against the org governance floor
   and the project's own strikes, waivers, and sign-offs, then renders the
   manifest. It is read-only and runs no auditors.

2. **Get the counts.** Call `akka_ec_rollup` for the same directory. It returns
   the status counts by tier and by Definition-of-Done type as JSON. Use this
   as the headline so the user sees the shape of the build before the detail.

3. **Report plainly.** Lead with the rollup: how many conditions are settled,
   how many are waiting on the user, how many are blocked outside the project.
   Then surface the conditions that are `open` or `red`, each with its
   user-facing reason — the reason field is the action.

   State plainly that the auditors were not run, and that the machine-checkable
   conditions are therefore still `open` rather than failing. Do not present an
   unevaluated condition as a problem. Offer `/akka:conform` as the way to
   resolve them.

   Do not restate internal condition ids, check keys, or the words "auditor" /
   "coverage gate" / "adequacy review" in the summary. Offer *"say 'show
   details' for the full checklist"* and show the raw manifest only if asked.

## Key rules

- Read-only, always. Never run a build, a test, or a probe from this command,
  and never call `akka_ec_conform` or `akka_ec_summary` — both run the
  auditors, which is precisely what status must not do.
- Never characterize an unevaluated condition as passing or failing. It is
  `open` because nothing has looked at it yet, and saying otherwise is the one
  way this command can mislead.
- Do not change the project. No sign-offs, no strikes, no waivers, no mode
  changes as a side effect of showing status.

## Done When

- [ ] `akka_ec_status` was called and the manifest was resolved without running
      any auditor.
- [ ] `akka_ec_rollup` was called and its counts led the report.
- [ ] Conditions that are `open` or `red` were surfaced with their user-facing
      reasons (no internal ids, no machinery words).
- [ ] The report stated that the auditors did not run, and did not present
      unevaluated machine-checkable conditions as failures.
- [ ] Nothing in the project was modified.
